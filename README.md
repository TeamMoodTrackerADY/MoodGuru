## Overview
### Description
It is an app to track users' daily mood (i.e a journal but to track how they are feeling every day). The app will display a variety of emotions to the users as a mutiple choice question and they can choose whichever emotion that describes them the best of that day. Users will also be able to input ratings of their overall mood and specific emotions on a scale of 1-10. 

After a few days of inputting the users' mood, the app can display a chart of how the users have been feeling so far and give a rating of whether they have been feeling happy or not. It can give the users some suggestions on how to improve/ maintain their mental health based on that rating. Users can also input their own experience/suggestions into the pool so that others can see their suggestions.

Additionally, there will also be a note-taking/ journaling feature where the users can write down what they have been doing, how they have been feeling and their reflection for the day.


### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Emotion, health, informational
- **Mobile:** Instead of a desktop website, it is much more convenient and practical for the users to use their phone to track their mood and journal their daily lives on a mobile app. Whenever the users want to reflect their emotions, they can just do so in a blink of an eye in their own mobile device.
- **Story:** There have been other similar mood tracker Android apps in the market already. (**TODO: Look more into features in Android mood tracker apps!!**)
- **Market:** This app focuses on younger people such as college students and young working adults. But anyone could find this app helpful.
- **Habit:** Since this app's main purpose is to reflect and journal, it could form a healthy habit for the users. If they find suggestions or motivation notes helpful, they would be more likely to use it and gradually form a habit. 
- **Scope:** There is a lot of potential to increase the scope of this app since there are many extra features that can be implemented besides inputting daily moods and journaling. However, as of now, the required user stories should be helpful enough to the users.
